# n8n Automations

This repository contains personal backups of n8n workflows.

## Purpose

These workflows were created using [n8n](https://n8n.io/), a workflow automation tool that allows connecting APIs and services without writing full code. The goal of this repository is to preserve useful automations in case of data loss or account issues.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. In n8n, use **Import from File** to load any `.json` workflow.
3. Reconnect or reconfigure credentials and any environment-specific variables after import.

## Notes

- These workflows are not currently hosted or running anywhere.
- No environment variables, secrets, or sensitive data are included.
- Some workflows may require updates to endpoint URLs, credentials, or service configurations to work again.
- This repo is not actively maintained as a projectâ€”it's meant as a personal archive.

## Structure

Each folder or file represents a standalone automation, usually exported from the n8n editor.
